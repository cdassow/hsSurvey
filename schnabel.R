#Continuous Schnabel population estimate
#CTS 30 May 2018

#This is a quick and dirty version of Schnabel, based on Ricker 1975 (Computation and interpretation of biological
#statistics of fish populations) and Schabel 1938 (Am. Math. Mon.). It gives an approximation to the ML estimate of
#population size and the confidence limits are I think approximate too.
#Updated 30 July - wrote in option to use Poisson for CI when total number of recaps is low. Formula from Krebs,
#Ecological Methodology, in-prep edition posted on his web site. Should check.

  #Function to calculate continuous Schnabel population estimate
  
  #Arguments:
  #markedPrior - Number of fish marked prior to each sampling event. Vector; first element is first sample, etc.
  #collectedNow - Number of fish collected in each sampling event, including fish that were previously marked and those that weren't. Vector; first element is first sample, etc.
  #recapturedNow - Number of recaptures in each sampling event. Vector; first element is first sample, etc.
  
  #Value:
  #A data.frame giving the point estimate and the lower and upper bounds of a 95% CI for each sampling event.
  
  #Rename arguments for convenience
